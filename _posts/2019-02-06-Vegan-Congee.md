title: Field Roast Congee
---

I threw together a handful of ingredients for this one, wanted something quick
to make. I'd made congee before, but not vegan. Having a pressure cooker
helps a lot - I think an Instant Pot is a good investment.

### Ingredients

- 1 cup rice (any rice will do, I use calrose white rice)
- 6 cups water
- 2 Tbsp Better than Bullion Vegetable Base
- 1 package (12 oz) [Field Roast Apple Sage][froast] sausages
- 8 oz sliced mushrooms (crimini or something)
- ginger to taste (fresh is probably better but ground is fine)
- salt and pepper to taste
- (optional) 2-3 tsp toasted sesame oil

You can change any of this up - use bullion instead, or vegetable stock, or
some other kind of protein.

### Prep

1. Rinse the rice once if you want, don't rinse it clear. Starch is your friend
here, it makes the congee thicker.
2. Add rice to the pressure cooker.
3. Premix bullion (including better than bullion) if you're using it. I mix
it in a measuring cup with water from a kettle.
4. Add stock/broth.
5. Optionally, brown the sausages. I haven't tried this.
6. Slice the sausages.
7. Add mushrooms.
8. Add ginger and some pepper.

### Cooking

This is where the pressure cooker comes in handy.

1. Bring to pressure and hold for 20 minutes. On an Instant Pot, this is the
"Normal" setting for "Porridge" or "Congee" depending on your model.
2. Let the pressure release naturally. Starch will clog up the release valve
otherwise.
3. Finish! Salt and pepper to taste, probably add some more ginger, and if you
have some, add some toasted sesame oil. It rounds out the flavor.

Maybe try adding some kind of leafy brassica at the end. I dunno.
