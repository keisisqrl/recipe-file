Pasta, garlic, capers, Field Roast. This one is my partner's recipe and it is a quick and easy weeknight meal. 

We usually do this with Chipotle field roast, but I like Apple Sage too. 

### Ingredients

* One box some kind of macaroni pasta. I like farfalle (bowties)
* olive oil. Enough. Just keep the bottle handy. 
* 4-6 cloves garlic, chopped
* 1 package Field Roast sausage (any variety, not franks), sliced 
* 1.5ish Tbsp capers
* (optional) a handful of sliced Kalamata olives
* 1-2 tsp dried Italian seasoning 
* black pepper 
* some salt 

### Instructions 

1. Boil some water for the pasta and get that going. Underdone is better than overdone.  
2. Heat some oil in a large skillet on medium heat. 
3. Sauté the garlic until it begins to turn brown. 
4. Add the sausage then sauté until browned. You might need more oil. 
5. Add capers and olives, heat. 
6. Stir in Italian seasoning and add some black pepper and salt. 
6. Stir in cooked pasta and sauté until heated through. 

Fills a large skillet.
