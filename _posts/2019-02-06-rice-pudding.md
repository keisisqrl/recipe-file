I'd be remiss if I didn't cite my [source][] for this. 

You'll need to watch out to keep this from boiling over - milk likes to do that!

### Ingredients

* 6 cups milk (I used 2%, it's what we keep around)
* 1 cup rice (I used calrose)
* 1/4 white sugar
* 2 tsp ground cinnamon
* 2 tsp pure vanilla extract 
* 1/4 cup raisins (I didn't measure, just grab a handful that feels right)
* 1/2 cup condensed milk (trust me this is worth it)

### Instructions

1. Combine everything except the condensed milk in a large saucepan and boil.    
   It's okay if you accidentally add the condensed milk here. I don't think it comes out as good, but it's fine.
2. Simmer for 15-20 minutes until thick and creamy. Stir regularly - use a wooden spoon and
scrape the pan. You don't want things burning!
3. Now add the condensed milk.

Serve immediately - but also this reheats *really* well.
